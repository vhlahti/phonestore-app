Design-wise, the Galaxy S10 sets itself apart from the previous generation with its offset punch-hole 10MP selfie camera, which is capable of capturing stabilized 4K footage. The camera is the only thing interrupting the gorgeous 6.1-inch OLED display. The cameras at the back are three - the regular 12MP is joined by a 12MP telephoto and a 16MP wide-angle one, a first for the Galaxy S series.",
